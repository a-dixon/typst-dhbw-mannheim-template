# Typst template for faculty Technik at DHBW

As an example and guide how to use this template,
check out [this PDF document](./Template-Example-guide.pdf).

The template can be configured to English or German language.

To compile your document,
you need to take the `thesis.typ` file as the input file.
To use the CLI, compile using `typst watch thesis.typ`
or `typst compile thesis.typ`.

If you intend to use the VS Code extension "Typst-LSP", don't,
and use the Tinymist Typst extension instead.

This is a adapted version of a template by [@satoqz](https://github.com/satoqz/).
